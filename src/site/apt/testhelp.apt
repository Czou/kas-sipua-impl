	Deprecated: Since version 1.1.2 No external proxy is required to test SIP STACK
		
Kurento SIP library Test bed

	In order to test Kurento SIP User Agent ï¿½ is required an {{{http://www.opensips.org}OpenSips}}
	instance (any SIP Proxy would do) that routes SIP traffic.
	
	JUnit tests included in the code will not pass unless a SIP Proxy is listening in 
	localhost (127.0.0.1:5060).
	
	Next code snippet shows the minimal configuration required to run tests. 
	Configuration is tested with OpenSips version 1.6.4-2-notls.
